;;; Commentary:

;; An almost completely empty wrapper to simplify packaging on *elpa.

;;; Code:

(require 'pq-core nil t) ; Don't signal an error if the module is absent.

;; Try and compile the `pq-core' module when we compile the PQ package.
(eval-when-compile
  (unless (or (featurep 'pq-core)
              ;; Try and avoid running this code when we're just
              ;; loading the uncompiled `pq.el'.
              (and (fboundp 'macroexp-compiling-p) ;Emacsâ‰¥28
                   (not (macroexp-compiling-p))))
    (require 'pq-compile)
    (declare-function pq--compile-module "pq-compile" ())

;; Try and compile the `pq-core' module when the PQ package is loaded.
