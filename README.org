An Emacs 25 module for accessing PostgreSQL via the libpq client library.

Using libpq for client connections has various advantages over the
wire-protocol speaking pure elisp implementations.  For example, it
has better performance and supports all features of the protocol like
full TLS support and new authentication methods like scram-sha-256.

It doesn't expose many libpq features yet, but what's there should be
crash-safe no matter what you do in the lisp world.  I've been using
it for two years now for reading mail through my custom Gnus backend
without incidents.  If you make it crash, please report.

Basic usage:
: ELISP> (setq *pq* (pq:connectdb "dbname=andreas"))
: #<user-ptr ptr=0x55b466c02780 finalizer=0x7f7d50112236>
: ELISP> (pq:query *pq* "select version()")
: ("PostgreSQL 9.6.7 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 6.3.0-18) 6.3.0 20170516, 64-bit")
: ELISP> (pq:query *pq* "create table local_variables(name text, value text)")
: nil
: ELISP> (dolist (el (buffer-local-variables))
: 	 (pq:query *pq* "insert into local_variables values ($1, $2)"
: 		   (car el) (cdr el)))
: nil
: ELISP> (pq:query *pq* "select name, length(value) from local_variables where value ~ 'mode'")
: (["major-mode" 24]
:  ["change-major-mode-hook" 86]
:  ["hi-lock-mode-major-mode" 24]
:  ["eldoc-mode-major-mode" 24]
:  ["font-lock-major-mode" 24]
:  ["font-lock-mode-major-mode" 24])

See the testsuite [[./test.el]] for all implemented features.

Note that =pq= silently converts bigints and numerics your queries
return to lisp floats because they don't fit into a lisp integer.
This looses precision on big values.  If you need the full precision,
cast them to =text= and use, e.g., =calc-eval= to do arbitrary
precision things with them.
